They are large and have a true pyriform shape, with a long neck and bulbous base. They ripen from a yellow-green to an all-over ruby red. The skin is smooth and dotted with lenticels, or pores, indicative of the fruit’s higher sugar content. They are harvested when just mature and ripen to a brilliant red color off the tree. The pear’s cream-colored flesh is fine-grained, crisp and juicy, and offers a sweet taste.
