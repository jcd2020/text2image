 They are elongated, oval to spherical fruits that are somewhat uniform in appearance with smooth, curved edges. The skin is firm, glossy, and thin, ripening from green to bright red when mature. Underneath the surface, the flesh is crunchy, aqueous, and red, encasing a central cavity filled with edible, cream-colored seeds suspended in clear liquid. They are known for their high sugar and water content, creating a juicy consistency with a sweet and savory flavor.
