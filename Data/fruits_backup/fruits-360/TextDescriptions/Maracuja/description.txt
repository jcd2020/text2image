They are large, round to oblong fruits with thick, bright yellow rinds. They are about 8 centimeters long and 4 centimeters wide. The skin is smooth and may be covered in light yellow specks. Mature fruits will be wrinkled and soft to the touch. Inside is a soft white pith and a large hollow cavity filled with brown, edible seeds encased in bright yellow, gelatinous pulp. The pulp has an intensely sweet, floral aroma with an acidic taste and tropical flavor.
