They are medium to large in size and are oblong in shape with a rounded bottom that gradually tapers to an elongated neck and a slender green-brown stem. The thick skin is golden tan and is covered in rough, brown russeting with some mottling. The ivory to off-white flesh is firm, dense, and crisp with an intense honeyed aroma and has a central, soft core encasing a few small black-brown seeds. When ripe, they are juicy, crunchy, and have a very sweet flavor with notes of woodsy spice.
