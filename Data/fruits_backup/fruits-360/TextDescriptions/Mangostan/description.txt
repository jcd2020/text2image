It is a tropical fruit about the size of a tangerine, averaging five to seven centimeters in diameter. It has a thick, smooth, leathery, burgundy-colored shell with about four to eight flat and woody lobes arranged in a rosette at the apex. Encased in the thick skin are an average of five or six triangular floral-scented segments of white, juicy, soft flesh, which is either seedless or contains just a few flat seeds. The number of lobes at the outer apex of the fruit actually correlates to the number of segments inside. They offer a sweet-tart tropical flavor with notes of lychee, peach, strawberry, pineapple, and caramel or butter.
