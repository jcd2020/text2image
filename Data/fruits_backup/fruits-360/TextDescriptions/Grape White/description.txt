tHEY are small to medium in size and are round to slightly oval in shape, growing in tight or loose clusters depending on the variety. The skin ranges from yellow-green to bright green and is typically crisp, firm, and smooth. The flesh is pale green, semi-translucent, and seedless, though some seedless varieties may have a few underdeveloped seeds that are undetectable when consumed. They are mild and sweet with a slightly tart flavor.
