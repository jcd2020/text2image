They are curious-looking fruits that grow on short trunked, densely branched, evergreen trees. They appear along branches and near the leaf joints following small, red stemmed, lilac and purple flowers. The fruits are oblong, maturing from a dark or light green to an orangey-yellow and have 5 (sometimes 6) ribs, or wings that are sometimes tipped with green. They range in size from 6 to 15 centimeters long and up to 9 centimeters wide. Beneath the thin and waxy skin is a yellow flesh that is juicy and crisp when fully ripe. Immature fruits are sour. When cut lengthwise into slices the resulting shape is that of a star. Most fruits will contain up to 12 tiny, flat, brown seeds. Ripe fruits will have a honeyed, tropical aroma, as well as sweet-tart tasting notes of plum and grape. The entire fruit is edible including skin and seeds.
