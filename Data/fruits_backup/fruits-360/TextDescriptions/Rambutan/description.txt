 The fruit may be greenish-yellow, orange or crimson, are oval-shaped and usually 1 - 2 inches long. The soft, flexible exterior shell is covered in stiff, hair-like bristles. While the exterior makes it seem larger than the lychee, the inner fruit is actually smaller. Its flesh is juicy, milky- white, translucent in color, with a grape-like, gelatinous texture surrounding a central seed with and almond-like taste. The flavor is more acidic than the lychee, sweet and very aromatic.
