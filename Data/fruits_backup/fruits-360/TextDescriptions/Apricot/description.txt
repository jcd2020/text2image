They are petite, round to slightly oblong fruits with smooth and velvety skin. The skin often has a rosy blush, and can range in color from pale yellow, to golden, to a burnt orange, depending on the variety and how ripe they are. The flesh is smooth, juicy, tender, and sweet, with just a bit of tartness at the end. The flavor is often described as being somewhere between a peach and a plum. They are classified as stone fruits or drupes, characterized by their thin skin, pulpy middle, and single, hard, central shell enclosing a pit or stone.
