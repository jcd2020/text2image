They are yellow-orange, thin-skinned spherical fruits with slightly flattened ends. Each fruit is 5 to 7 centimeters in diameter, with stiff, green glossy leaves on their tops. The pulp is a reddish, sometimes dark bronze color, and each fruit contains between 1 to 8 seeds. The texture of the ripe fruit is juicy, and soft to the point of being mushy. The flavor is rich and sweet, with tasting notes of pear, apricot, and a hint of bourbon vanilla.
