It received its name because its coloring is so similar to that of a green apple, with hues of lemon and lime. The fruit is roughly spherical with a furrowed smooth surface. The most alluring element is its fragrance, a bouquet of bright tropical aromatics. The flesh is unique to many fruits, its texture a combination of a firm banana with the succulence of an apple. Tiny edible seeds pattern the flesh's core. The flavor is a reflection of its aromatics, though more subtle with notes of pineapple, papaya, banana and lemon.
