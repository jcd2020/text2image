They are large, somewhat uniform tubers with an oval, round, to oblong shape. The skin is thin, smooth, and light yellow to beige, covered in small, shallow eyes and brown spots. Underneath the surface, the flesh ranges in color from golden yellow to white, depending on cultivation, and is dense, waxy, high in moisture, and low in starch. They hold their shape well when cooked and have a mild, earthy, and neutral flavor.
