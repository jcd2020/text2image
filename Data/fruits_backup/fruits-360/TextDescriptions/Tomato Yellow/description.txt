They are golden-yellow, characterized by their meaty texture and larger size that lends itself to slicing. They have thick skin and succulent, meaty, and very weighty flesh, as they naturally have a high water content. They produce the large fruit, each weighing up to one pound, along upright sprawling vines, which is why they are often recommended for caging or staking. They are rather sweet, and often taste milder and less acidic than red ones because the different pigments in various colored varieties produce different balances of sugars and acids. So itâ€™s this unique combination of sugar and acid levels, as well as other compounds, that accounts for the milder taste, and it does not necessarily mean that it is less acidic than their red counterpart.
