They are medium to large in size and are globular in shape with rounded or slightly tapered ends. The bulb is encased in a bright white, papery, parchment-like skin that is flaky, dry, and thin. Underneath the skin, the white, almost translucent flesh is firm, crisp, and juicy with many layers of thin white rings. They are crunchy and tender with a pungent, mildly sweet flavor and have a mellow, non-abrasive aftertaste.
