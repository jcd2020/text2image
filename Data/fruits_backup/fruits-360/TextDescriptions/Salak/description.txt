 They grow in clusters at the base of the Rakum palm, a spine-covered palm that grows in small clumps averaging 3 to 4 meters high. Technically classified as a drupe, the fruits are 2 to 3 centimeters long and ovate with an elongated tapering tip. Their scaly exterior is brownish-orange and slightly rough to the touch. It easily peels away revealing 2 to 3 lobes of juicy white flesh that house hard, brown inedible seeds. While other Snake fruit may by crunchy and mild, this variety is much juicier, softer and bursting with flavors of pineapple, peach and pear.
