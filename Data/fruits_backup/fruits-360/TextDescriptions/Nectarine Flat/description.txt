They are distinguished by their shape, their fuzz-free skin and the fruits' sub acid, high sugar content. Their shape is roughly rounded and squat with a sunken center at its stem end. The fruit's skin is thin and flushed with tones of rouge, ivory and rose. When ripe, the creamy flesh is perfumed with confectionery aromatics, extremely juicy and tender-firm with a delicate melting quality. Its flavor has a rich syrup-like sweetness, unmatched by other white varieties.
