They are medium-sized and have a conical shape. They are broadly round at the top and taper at the base. The thick skin turns bright red well before the fruits are fully ripe, which can lead to early harvests. As they mature, the skin becomes a darker red with white lenticels visibly dotting the surface. The fine-grained flesh is creamy white, crisp and juicy and offers a mildly sweet taste with flavors of melon.
