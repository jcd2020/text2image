They grow in pairs within round spiky green flowers, also known as catkins. The hard, thin-shelled nuts are a shiny brown and measure between 3 and 4 centimeters in diameter. Each nut has one flattened side, where it was pressed against the second seed as it developed. The flesh is a creamy white with a firm, crisp texture. They have a starchy, meaty texture when boiled or roasted and have a mild and slightly sweet flavor.
