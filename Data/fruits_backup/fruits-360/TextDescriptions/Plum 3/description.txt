They are a small variety approximately the size of a large cherry. They have thick, dark blue, bloomy skins that are rich in acrid tasting tannins. The interior has a low flesh to seed ratio, with a somewhat dry texture. The greenish-gold tinted, translucent pulp is tart and more fibrous than conventional fruits found in typical grocery stores. Clearly not meant for a raw snack, these fruits cook down into a rich and silky jam with hints of spice and bramble berries.
