They are a medium to large sized mango variety weighing up to two pounds each. They are broadly oval shaped with a green skin almost always covered with a dark red blush with occasional orange or yellow accents. The smooth skin is covered with small, yellow-green lenticels (pores) that appear like freckles. The skin is thick, protecting the firm, deep yellow flesh during shipping.They are juicy, with a somewhat fibrous flesh, and a mildly sweet taste. The fruit must be lightly squeezed to determine ripeness.
