They are small to medium in size and are round to slightly oblong in shape, growing in medium to large clusters. The hue can vary widely depending on the variety and local growing conditions, but it usually ranges from a light red to a deep burgundy. The thin skin may also contain a dusty film, also known as a bloom, and this layer forms a natural waterproof barrier which prevents the delicate skin from cracking. The translucent flesh is juicy and is considered seedless, though a few small undetectable and undeveloped seeds may be present. They are firm, crisp, and sweet with a mild, neutral flavor.
