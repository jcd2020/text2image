They are medium-sized fruits, measuring 7 to 9 centimeters in diameter, and have a round, flat shape with a dimpled center at each end. Their thin skins are yellow or orange and flushed with hues of ivory, rose, and rouge covered with a velvety finish. They have white flesh that is soft and juicy, surrounding a non-clinging, easy to remove, pit. They are low in acid with a candy-like sweetness and notes of almond.
