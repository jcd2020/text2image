They are medium to large in size and have a true pyriform, or pear shape, which has a large rounded base that tapers to a smaller curved neck with a light brown stem. The thin skin brightens as it ripens, transforming from green to a golden yellow, and is smooth and firm with some blushing and russeting. The flesh is aromatic, moist, cream-colored to ivory, and is fine-grained encasing a central core containing a few small, black-brown seeds. When mature but not fully ripe, they are crunchy, tart, and slightly gritty, but when fully ripe, they develop a juicy, smooth, buttery texture with a sweet flavor.
