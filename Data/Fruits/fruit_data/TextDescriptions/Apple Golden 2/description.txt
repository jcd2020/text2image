They are small to medium and slightly oblong to round in size. The skin is smooth, matte, and is a deep yellow-green speckled with faint white lenticels, or spots, and light ribbing. The fine-grained flesh is creamy white, crisp, and tender. There is also a tough and fibrous central core that runs the length of the fruit and extends to the base of the long and slender stem. They are juicy and smooth with a sweet flavor with nuances of spice.
