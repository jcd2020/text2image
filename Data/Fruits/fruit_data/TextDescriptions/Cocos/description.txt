They are medium to large in size, averaging thirty centimeters in diameter and thirty-eight centimeters in length, and are oval to oblong in shape with many layers of protective shell. The dark brown husk, also known as the mesocarp, is thick, fibrous, dense, and firm. This outer shell is very similar in appearance to a mature one seen on the tree. Underneath the husk, a grey-brown, inedible shell surrounds the core known as the endocarp and has three germination pores or eyes on the stem-end. Inside the endocarp, a very thin layer of oil and white meat surrounds a thick, sponge-like flesh that has a yellow, grooved exterior and a pure white interior. The flesh has a crisp, lightweight, and tender texture, similar to the crunch of an Asian pear or wax apple, but contains a snap-like quality that quickly dissipates into a soft, melting consistency. They have a faint, musky aroma and a tangy, subtle salinity, with a mild and savory taste mixed with a light sweetness similar to angel food cake.
