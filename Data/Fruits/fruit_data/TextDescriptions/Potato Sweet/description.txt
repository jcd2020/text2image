They generally share the same cylindrical shape with tapered ends, but they can vary in size, measuring up to 12 inches long and weighing up to about one pound. The relatively smooth skin can range in color from white to golden-brown or copper-red to purple, and the dense flesh can be firm or soft, varying from white to yellow or orange, or even mauve to deep magenta-purple. In general, varieties with white flesh have a firmer and drier texture, while orange-fleshed varieties are soft and moist. They offer a sugary-sweet flavor with earthy undertones and hints of nuttiness, with some varieties being sweeter than others.
