They are medium-sized fruits, measuring an average of 4 centimeters in diameter, with deep red to maroon-colored skin. The plump fruits are very round and slightly heart-shaped with the characteristic vertical suture running from stem to end. They have a firm, blood red flesh with a crisp, juicy texture. They are semi-freestone, so the flesh clings only slightly to the central pit. They offer a mildly sweet taste with no acidity.
