The fruits grow in clusters. They ripen within a month from green to brilliant orange. Once mature, the fruit can reach up to 2 inches in length. Unlike citruses, the entire fruit is edible, although the few seeds buried in the flesh are recommended to be spared. The peel is where the true citrus sweetness lies in both aroma and flavor. The flesh offers a bold and juicy tart contrast, making for a sweet tart mouthful. Before disposing of or simply eating, consider saving the seeds, as they are a source of natural pectin.
