They are not botanically classified as a berry, but rather an aggregate of many tiny fruit clusters arranged around a central stem. They are similar in appearance to an elongated blackberry, although they can ripen to a deep purple, black, red or white, depending on the variety. They have a good balance of sweet and tart flavors, sometimes with a hint of baking spices or woody cedar. The aromatic, deeply colored fruits are fragile and syrupy, and are known to stain at the slightest touch. The productive trees can reach anywhere from 30 to 80 feet tall, and some species can live and produce fruit for centuries.
