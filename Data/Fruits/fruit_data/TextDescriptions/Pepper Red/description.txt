They are medium to large in size, averaging seven centimeters in length and five centimeters in diameter, and are rounded, square, and globular in shape with 3-4 lobes and a thick green stem. The smooth skin is firm, glossy, and pale green when young transforming to a bright red when mature. Underneath the skin, the pale red flesh is thick, crisp, and succulent with a hollow cavity that contains very small, flat cream-colored seeds and a thin membrane. They are crunchy and juicy with a very sweet flavor.
