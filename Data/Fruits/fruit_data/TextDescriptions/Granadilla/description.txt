They are small in size, averaging 6-8 centimeters in length and 3-5 centimeters in diameter, and are oblong and elongated in shape with a very lightweight, hollow feel. The firm rind is brittle, smooth, and thick, initially appearing green and then transforming into an orange-yellow hue covered in light tan to white specks with maturity. Underneath the rind, the fruit is filled with a mucilaginous, pale white to almost clear pulp that encases many small, flat black seeds. They are aromatic with a slippery, moist, and smooth texture layered over a crunchy center, and have a bright, sweet, and mildly tart, fruity flavor.
