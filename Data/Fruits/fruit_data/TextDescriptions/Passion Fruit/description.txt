It is a small, oval to round shaped fruit, approximately two to three inches in diameter at maturity. The fruit's skin is smooth, yet dimpled and at peak maturity can be heavily wrinkled. The skin's color varies with hues of dark purple and red. Below the skin is a cottony white peel. The interior seed cavity is filled with edible yellow to green jelly and medium sized black seeds. Its pulp is highly aromatic and has a tropical sweet tart flavor with nuances of pineapple, papaya, mango, citrus and guava.
