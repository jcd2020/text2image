They are medium to large in size, averaging seven centimeters in length and five centimeters in diameter, and are rounded, square, and globular in shape with 3-4 lobes and a thick green stem. The smooth skin is firm, glossy, and pale green when young transforming to bright orange when mature. Underneath the skin, the pale orange flesh is thick, juicy, crisp, and succulent, with a hollow cavity that contains very small, flat cream-colored seeds and a thin membrane. They are crunchy with a sweet taste.
