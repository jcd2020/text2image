They are small in size, averaging 5-7 centimeters in length, and are symmetrical in shape with a rounded, bell-shaped base tapering to a short neck with a slender light green stem. The smooth, thin skin transforms from green to yellow when ripe and is covered in red blushing, crimson lenticels or pores, and has a slightly waxy sheen. The flesh is dense, coarse, moist, and off-white to cream-colored, encasing a few black-brown, tear-drop shaped seeds in a central core. When ripe, they are crisp with sweet and tangy flavors and a hint of cinnamon.
