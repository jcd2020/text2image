Varying in color from deep blue to purple or almost black, the large round fruit grows in loose clusters on sturdy climbing vines. A powdery film, or bloom, develops on the skin’s surface which provides a natural waterproofing and also prevents cracking. The berries’ thick, tannin-rich skin offers a pleasant chewiness against the juicy and almost gelatinous inner pulp. The seedy flesh is almost translucent with a slight green tinge and is both tangy and rich. Its unique sweet musky flavor is sometimes described as “foxy”.
