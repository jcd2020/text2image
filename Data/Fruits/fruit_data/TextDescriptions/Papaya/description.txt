They widely vary in size, ranging from 15-50 centimeters in length and 10-20 centimeters in diameter, and are oval to elongated in shape. The thin skin is smooth, slightly waxy, and firm with variegated hues of orange, yellow, and green depending on maturity. Underneath the surface, the flesh is crisp, dense, tender, and dark orange with a central seed cavity filled with pale orange membranes and many dark brown seeds. When ripe, they have a creamy and smooth consistency with a tropical, musky, and subtly sweet flavor.
