They are medium in size, averaging eight centimeters in diameter, and are short, squat, and egg-shaped with a wide base that gradually tapers to a rounded top with a thick, dark-brown stem. The skin is bright green, smooth, firm, and is covered in lenticels or pores and some rose blush on the side most exposed to the sun. The flesh is white to cream-colored, dense, and buttery with a slightly gritty texture. When ripe, they are juicy and soft with subtle, sweet flavors and notes of lemon and lime.
