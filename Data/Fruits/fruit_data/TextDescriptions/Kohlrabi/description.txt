It is medium to large in size with a round, bulbous stem averaging 7-10 centimeters in diameter and long leafy greens growing directly from the stem. The swollen stemâ€™s skin is pale green, firm, and smooth, covered by two layers of rosette-shaped, dark green leaves. Underneath the skin, the flesh is bright white, aqueous, dense, and crisp with a faint, cabbage-like scent. It is juicy and crunchy with a mild, peppery, and sweet flavor reminiscent of broccoli, cabbage, and cucumber.
