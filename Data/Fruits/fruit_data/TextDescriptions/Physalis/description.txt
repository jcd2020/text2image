They are globular fruits, averaging 1 to 2 centimeters in diameter, and are encased in a green to tan, papery husk that forms an inflated, lantern shape. The skin of the fruit is initially waxy and slightly sticky when removed from the husk, giving way to a smooth and taut consistency. The skin also transitions from green to orange-yellow when ripe. Underneath the surface, the flesh is aqueous, soft, yellow-orange, and is filled with many small, crunchy, and edible, cream-colored seeds. They have a sweet-tart flavor that is reminiscent of a cherry tomato crossed with tangy notes of pineapple, mango, vanilla, strawberry, and Meyer lemon.
