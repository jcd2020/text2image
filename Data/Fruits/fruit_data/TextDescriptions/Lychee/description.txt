They are oval-round and petite, roughly the size of a walnut, and their leathery skin is covered with tiny spikes. Young fruits start out green, and as they mature, they become blushed with pink and eventually turn a bright red. The pearly-white pulp is covered in juice and houses a dark-brown seed at its center, which can vary in size from 1/2 inch to 1 inch in length, depending on the variety. The firm yet gelatinous pulp is chewy and juicy with a sweet, fruity flavor, like a cross of strawberry and watermelon with a touch of pineapple-like acidity. They are also fragrant with a tropical scent and a hint of roses.
