They are medium to large in size, averaging seven centimeters in length and five centimeters in diameter, and are bulbous, square, and globular in shape with 3-4 lobes and a thick green stem. The smooth skin is firm, glossy, and bright green with thick-walled, pale-green flesh that is juicy, crisp, and succulent. Inside the flesh, there is a hollow cavity that contains very small, cream-colored seeds and a thin membrane. They are crunchy with a grassy, mildly bitter taste.
