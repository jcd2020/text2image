They grow on shrubby trees that average between 5 and 8 meters tall. Ranging in color from deep magenta to bright red, the spherical fruits are roughly the size of an apple and have a thin but tough, leathery skin. The interior of the fruit is filled with seeds, technically called arils. The seeds are the edible portion. Each seed is enclosed in a translucent, bright red pulp that offers a sweet-tart taste with notes of cranberry, rhubarb, red currant and concord grape.
