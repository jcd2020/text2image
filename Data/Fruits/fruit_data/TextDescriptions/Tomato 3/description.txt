They are large, plump fruits with thin skin that is deep red in color. Their pulpy flesh is the same color as the skin, with a bouquet that has been likened to that of roses. They are full-bodied and non-acidic, with an excellent, robust flavor. The large, regular-leaf, indeterminate plants produce high yields of the eight to twelve ounce fruit in clusters of four to six along vigorous vines with serrated leaves.
