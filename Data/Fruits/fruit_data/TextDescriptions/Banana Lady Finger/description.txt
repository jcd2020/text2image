They grow on tall, slender trees that can reach anywhere from 5 to 25 feet in height. They are thinner than the more common cavendish bananas and have a cigar-like shape. They grow up to 5 inches long and are roughly half an inch in diameter. They have thin, bright yellow skins that will develop dark flecks when fully ripe. The fruit has a creamy consistency, with a sweeter flavor than common bananas.
